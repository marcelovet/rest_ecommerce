## Backend Setup

#### Requirements

* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/).
* [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for Python package and environment management.

By default, the dependencies are managed with [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)

1. **Create a virtual environment**
   ```bash
   cd backend # Assuming you are in the project directory
   uv sync
   source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

2. **Generate RSA keys**
   ```bash
   openssl genrsa -out private_key.pem 2048
   openssl rsa -in private_key.pem -pubout -out public_key.pem
   ```

3. **Configure the .ini file**
   ```bash
   touch config.ini
   ```

   Add the same sections and values to `.env/config.ini` as in `ini_example`.

4. **Run alembic migrations**
   ```bash
   alembic upgrade head
   ```

5. **add initial data to database**
   ```bash
   python app/initial_data.py
   ```

6. **...**

This project is being created as a portfolio piece to demonstrate backend development capabilities with FastAPI and modern web technologies.
