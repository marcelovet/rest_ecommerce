### Supabase Setup

1. **Create Your .env File**
  
  Create a `.env` file in the supabase directory of the project (use env_example.env as a template).

2. **Pull the images**
   ```bash
   cd supabase # Assuming you are in the project directory
   docker compose pull
   ```

3. **Run the containers**
   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```
### Backend Setup

1. **Create a virtual environment**
   ```bash
   cd app # Assuming you are in the project directory
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Generate RSA keys**
   ```bash
   openssl genrsa -out private_key.pem 2048
   openssl rsa -in private_key.pem -pubout -out public_key.pem
   ```

4. **Configure the .ini file**
   ```bash
   mkdir .envs
   touch .envs/config.ini
   ```

   Add the same sections and values to `.env/config.ini` as in `config_example.ini`.
